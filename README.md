<h2> Synopsis </h2>

I'm trying to learn more about creating games, so I started following Bryan Bibat's [HTML5 Shoot 'em Up in an Afternoon](https://leanpub.com/html5shootemupinanafternoon) tutorial for making a 1942 style arcade game. This is an excellent step-by-step tutorial, that is easy to read and follow along, I highly recommend it.

<h2> Motivation </h2>

I am a keen gamer and after learning to code, decided I would try and learn a lot more about game coding. I think the fastest way to learn anything (in this case JavaScript) is by doing something you are passionate about.

<h2> Installation </h2>

This game requires a simple server to run (for an explanation, please read https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started/part2 )

I use the simple Python server, So I can open a console and type

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

then open a web browser and go to

http://localhost:8000/

<h2> Framework </h2>

The game was built using:

Javascript
HTML
CSS

<h2> ToDo </h2>

* Change the sprites sheets with something of my own design.

* Add more powerups.

* change the background image to randomly selected tiles.

* Look at having a second player, either on the same keyboard (WASD) or online using Firebase (or something similar)
